SimpleJsonWriter
=================================================

For this homework, you will create a class that outputs various collections as "pretty" JSON objects or arrays to file. Use **tab characters** for each level of indentation and use line separators between elements. For example, a "pretty" JSON array looks like:

```json
[
	1,
	2,
	3
]
```

Note that there is no comma after the last element in the array. Objects look like:

```json
{
	"ant": 1,
	"bat": 2,
	"cat": 3
}
```

Note that strings and keys are always in `"` quotation marks, but numbers are not. A nested object looks like:

```json
{
	"ant": [
		1
	],
	"bat": [
		1,
		2
	],
	"cat": [
		1,
		2,
		3
	]
}
```

Use `UTF8` when writing your files. See the Javadoc comments in the template code for additional details.

## Optional ##

It is possible to pass the tests with a less-than ideal implementation. Focus first on passing the tests by the deadline. Once you have working implementations, try to improve your solution as follows:

  - [ ] Do not use String replacement. Use iteration instead.

  - [ ] Reuse methods as much as possible. You should be able to use `asArray` within your `asNestedArray` method.

  - [ ] Try to avoid needing extra logic within your loops. For example, avoid testing *every* element to see if it is the last one.
  
  - [ ] Try to reduce repeated code. If you notice you had to copy and paste a chunk of code, it might be a good to use move that logic into a method.

The above does not need to be completed by the homework deadline, but will be required to pass code reviews for similar functionality in the projects.

## Hints ##

Below are some hints that may help with this homework assignment:

  - Eclipse has built-in file comparison functionality. It can show you exactly how your file output differs from the expected output (even if its just a trailing space at the end of a line).

  - If you directly call `write()` an `int` or `Integer`, it will often be seen as a character code. For example, `65` is the character code for `A`. If you want to actually write the digits `65` to file, convert to a `String` object first. For example, try running this:
    ```java
    PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(System.out);
    Integer i = 65;
    writer.write(i);
    writer.flush();
    ```

    Compare that output to:
    ```java
    PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(System.out);
    Integer i = 65;
    writer.write(i.toString());
    writer.flush();
    ```

    Note this is not a problem for most `print()` and `println()` methods, so it depends on what you use to write to file.

  - The [official JSON documentation](http://www.json.org/) can be a little difficult to parse. There [are](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/JSON) [many](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) [other](http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/JSON/article.html) [tutorials](https://www.google.com/search?q=json+examples) out there.

These hints are *optional*. There may be multiple approaches to solving this homework.

## Requirements ##

See the Javadoc and `TODO` comments in the template code in the `src/main/java` directory for additional details. You must pass the tests provided in the `src/test/java` directory. Do not modify any of the files in the `src/test` directory.

See the [Homework Guides](https://usf-cs212-fall2020.github.io/guides/homework/) for additional details on homework requirements and submission.
